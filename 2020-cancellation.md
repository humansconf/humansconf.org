# #humansconf 2020 is cancelled!

The following message was shared with everybody interested in #humansconf and registered participants, on 21-March-2020.

> Dear all who are interested in #humansconf,
> 
> with heavy heart we must tell you that #humansconf is cancelled and will not happen as planned!
> 
> Given the current circumstances, a global pandemic causing lockdowns all over the world and especially in the area of the conference venue, there really is not much of a choice there.
> 
> However, we don't give up on #humansconf. It will be back, latest in 2021!
> 
> Until then, we plan to experiment with some online formats. After all, we still believe strongly in the idea that people and empathic, human-centered interactions are the most important factor for successful products and projects.  
> Please do reach out to us at [hello@humansconf.org](mailto:hello@humansconf.org) or ping [@humansconf on Twitter](https://twitter.com/humansconf), if you have ideas or wishes with regards to online formats.
>
> Lastly, we really want to thank you!  
> All of you, who registered for #humansconf or who showed their interest and support for our vision of the conference. Thank you for your trust in us and our vision!
> 
> Our hearts go out to all of you! Take care of yourself, your loved ones and others during these trying times!
>
> <i>[The organizers](/organizers)</i>
