We offer a small contingent of inclusivity grants to people from under-indexed groups. A grant will cover all costs of of staying at the conference. The details of what costs this includes, are described [here](/costs). grants do not cover travel expenses. If you receive a grant and also need assistance in covering travel costs, please reach out to us at [hello@humansconf.org](mailto:hello@humansconf.org)

Please note, itâ€™s not yet fully clarified how many grants we will be able to grant. We can therefore not guarantee every person who applies for a grant, that their application will be granted.

## Applying for an Inclusivity Grant

In order to apply for a inclusivity grant you need to register for the conference. During the registration process, you will be asked if you want to apply for a inclusivity grant.


## Sponsoring an Inclusivity Grant

As a sponsor of grants you will receive recognition of the #humansconf community by being mentioned multiple times by our [Twitter account @humansconf](https://twitter.com/humansconf) and during the conference. Furthermore, as a grant sponsor you can be sure to make people smile, make the world a better place and enjoy a warm fuzzy feeling
that comes with having done the right thing. ðŸ˜Š

The costs of sponsoring one grant are detailed on the [Costs](/costs) page. Of course, a single sponsor can cover the costs of multiple grants.
