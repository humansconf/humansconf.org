## Format
We are a conference about trust, empathy, caring and openness. This is why #humansconf will be an [open space](https://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php?page=OpenSpace) conference. 

We will enjoy of 2 full days of open space at #humansconf. Each day will begin with everyone in the same room creating the schedule for the rest of the day together. In an open space, anyone can propose a session and everyone is encouraged to do so! Each person will present their session to the group and choose a timeslot and a place for it. 

At #humansconf, the main topic is people and their interactions. We all live in a community and we all work with others. Expect the sessions to be about people’s experiences, challenges we’ve met and how we’ve overcome them. How we’ve organized teams to build successful technology, but also how we’ve failed in our endeavors and what we learned from those failures. 

There is no template for a session. Some might be as simple as a group of people in a room discussing a topic. Some might even be the session’s sponsor asking a question that they really want to hear different answers for. And some might even be fully prepared presentations. You can expect a lot of spontaneous shifts in what a session means depending on the people that join them. 

And that’s what’s beautiful about open space. And what’s great about us, about humans. We have the ability to come together and construct just about anything. #humansconf will be a big space to do just that. 

## Language
We will be sharing our experiences with fellow humans from many different backgrounds. As such, #humansconf language is English, as the most common denominator among us. We encourage everyone to speak English at all times, even when in small groups in order to be more inviting towards other participants who might like to join in on the discussion. 

## Schedule
The conference will run from late afternoon of Thursday the 21st of May, to late afternoon of Saturday the 23rd. Here’s how that will look like: 

### Thursday
We expect check-in to start at around 4:00pm. 

#humansconf will begin at 5:00pm. We’ll say hi to the people we know, and get to meet new faces, settle down in our rooms and explore the venue a bit. 

Dinner buffet will be served at 6:00pm so everyone can get a nice meal before starting any evening activities. 

### Friday
After breakfast, we’ll all meet in the same room to start planning the day’s open space schedule with a marketplace. Shortly thereafter the sessions will begin. We’ll have lunch break after the first block, and carry on until the late afternoon with the rest of the sessions. 

At the end of the day, we’ll all meet again in the same room where we started to have a joint reflection on how the day went. 

Dinner will be served by the hotel in the evening and there’ll be enough rooms and spaces for any kind of activities you might propose.

### Saturday
The day will run in the same manner as friday, but it will end with the closing of #humansconf in the late afternoon, between 5:00 and 6:00pm. Please, be aware that participants that leave the hotel this day won’t have access to the dinner being served by them.
