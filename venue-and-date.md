The venue is surrounded by beautiful nature, and can host up to 90 participants. The conference has the venue booked
exclusively for the duration of #humansconf, which allows for a great atmosphere of exchange, as everyone at the venue
will be a participant. Plus, the fact that the venue is a hotel, means there’s no additional travel between venue and
accommodation needed, but we all can focus on the conference without having to split up in the evenings. We just stay
where we are and use the space of the venue for whatever we like.

## Date

#humansconf will start in the late afternoon of Thursday 21 May 2020 and last until late afternoon of Saturday 23-May
2020.

## Getting to the Venue

The venue is located near Aschaffenburg, Germany, which again is ~50km away from Frankfurt am Main, a transport hub with
a well-connected train station and airport.

We will update this section with more detailed info, closer to the conference date, until then please refer to the
[venue website on how to get there](https://www.natuerlich-tagen.de/anreise/).
