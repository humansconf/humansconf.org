The venue is surrounded by beautiful nature, and can host up to 90 participants. The conference has the venue booked
exclusively for the duration of #humansconf, which allows for a great atmosphere of exchange, as everyone at the venue
will be a participant. Plus, the fact that the venue is a hotel, means there’s no additional travel between venue and
accommodation needed, but we all can focus on the conference without having to split up in the evenings. We just stay
where we are and use the space of the venue for whatever we like.

## Date

#humansconf will start in the late afternoon of Thursday 21 May 2020 and last until late afternoon of Saturday 23-May 2020.

## Getting to the Venue

The venue is located near Aschaffenburg, Germany, which again is ~50km away from Frankfurt am Main, a transport hub with
a well-connected train station and airport.

From Ashaffenburg you can either take:

- bus 24 towards Mensengesaess Im Breitfeld and get down at station Rueckersbach Schlucht, Johannesberg
- or a taxi.

If you are coming in from abroad you will want to fly to Frankfurt Airport which is about 45km away from the venue. From there you can board a 1-hour train to Aschaffenburg Hauptbahnhof.
