The venue is surrounded by beautiful nature, and can host up to 97 participants. The conference has the venue booked exclusively for the duration of #humansconf, which allows for a great atmosphere of exchange, as everyone at the venue will be a participant.

Plus, the fact that the venue is a hotel, means there’s no additional travel between venue and accommodation needed, but we all can focus on the conference without having to split up in the evenings. We just stay where we are and use the space of the venue for whatever we like.

## Food

We asked the venue, to serve only vegan food throughout the whole conference. Please be aware of this, when registering.


## Accessibility of the Venue

We're currently in the process of gathering detailed info about wheelchair accessibility of the venue, and will update this section soon. In case you have any questions with regards to this topic, don't hesitate to contact us at [hello@humansconf.org](mailto:{{ site.email }}), or [tweet at us](https://twitter.org/humansconf).


## Travelling to the Venue

The address of the venue is [Kolpingstr. 1, 63867 Johannesberg][venue-loc].

It's located near Aschaffenburg, Germany, which again is ~50km away from Frankfurt am Main, a transport hub with a well-connected train station and airport. 

### By Airplane

Frankfurt Airport (FRA) is about 45km away from the venue. From there you can board a 1-hour train to "Aschaffenburg Hbf", the train station closest to the venue.

If you arrive by airplane, please consider offsetting carbon-emissions, caused by your flight. We recommend [atmosfair](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/) for doing so, but of course you're free to choose a different way of offsetting.

### By Public Transport

The train station closest to the venue is "Aschaffenburg Hbf".  
Check out [bahn.de][bahnde-searchform] to find a train connection to that suits you.

_Unfortunately, 21-May is a public holiday in Germany, which makes travelling by public transport more challenging._

The only real option you have is taking a taxi from "Aschaffenburg Hbf", which costs ~30 EUR, and of course less if you share a ride.


## Travelling Home from the Venue

On Saturday 23-May, there's the regular bus line 24 running close-ish to the venue, from the stop [Rückersbach Schlucht][busstop-schlucht].

You can either use [bahn.de][bahnde-searchform] to search for a connection from this stop, or check the [official bus timetable][line24] (german only) on when to get from there to "Aschaffenburg Hbf".  
_Note, that on Saturday the last bus leaving "Rückersbach Schlucht" departs at 5:32pm._
