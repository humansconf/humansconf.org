We offer a small contingent of sponsored scholarships to people from under-indexed groups. A scholarship will cover all
costs of of staying at the conference. The details of what costs this includes, are described [here](/costs).
Scholarships do not cover travel expenses. If you receive a scholarship and also need assistance in covering travel
costs, please reach out to us at [hello@humansconf.org](mailto:hello@humansconf.org)

Please note, itâ€™s not yet fully clarified how many scholarships we will be able to grant. We can therefore not guarantee
every person who applies for a scholarship, that their application will be granted.

## Applying for a Sponsored Scholarship

In order to apply for a sponsored scholarship you need to register for the conference. During the registration process,
you will be asked if you want to apply for a sponsored scholarship.


## Sponsoring a Scholarship

As a sponsor of scholarships you will receive recognition of the #humansconf community by being mentioned multiple times
by our [Twitter account @humansconf](https://twitter.com/humansconf) and during the conference. Furthermore, as a
scholarship sponsor you can be sure to make people smile, make the world a better place and enjoy a warm fuzzy feeling
that comes with having done the right thing. ðŸ˜Š

The costs of sponsoring one scholarship are detailed on the [Costs](/costs) page. Of course, a single sponsor can cover
the costs of multiple scholarships.
