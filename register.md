## How to get a Ticket for #humansconf

Getting a ticket for participating at #humansconf is 3-step procedure:
- Register for our ticket lottery via the [our registration form](registerform)
- Wait until we notify you via email, that you won a ticket in the lottery
- Accept your ticket within 72 hours after receiving your notification email, by visiting the sign-up link that you'll receive as part of the notification email

## How the Ticket Lottery works

Tickets for #humansconf are raffled in periodic lottery runs and there are two ticket pools from which tickets are drawn:

1. Single rooms
2. Double rooms

We will ask you during [registration][registerform] if you plan to come alone, or if you would like to bring others with you to the conference.

When answering that you'll bring others with you, you automatically enter the lottery for double rooms. If not, then your registration enters the lottery for single rooms.  
Registering for both lotteries, will dismiss your lottery entrance.

Getting a ticket in a lottery run means you get a room that you can fill as you want (with a partner, with a friend, with your family incl. kids etc.). Being in a room means having access to the conference.

### Reserved Ticket Quotas

A certain quota of tickets in each ticket pool are reserved for members from under-indexed groups, and for grantees of our [inclusivity grants](/inclusivity-grants).

If you identify as a member of an under-indexed group, you can check a checkbox during registration, which raises your chance of getting a ticket.[^1] We trust that you know best if it applies to you, so we will not ask for further evidence at anytime.

### Lottery Runs

The first lottery run will take place on 6-March, and after that as needed. This means the earliest notification emails will arrive during the day of 6-March.
