Humansconf takes place at the Seminar Zentrum Rueckerbach from 21-23 May 2020. The event will start in the late afternoon of 21-May (5pm local time) and end on 23-May (5-6pm local time).

The venue is surrounded by beautiful nature, and can host up to 90 participants (if all double rooms are used by two people). The conference has the venue booked exclusively for the duration of #humansconf, which allows for a great atmosphere of exchange, as everyone at the venue will be a participant. Plus, the fact that the venue is a hotel means that there is no additional travel between venue and accommodation.

## What is included in the price

The ticket includes the booked room, breakfast, lunch and dinner for the whole stay. Snacks, fruits, coffee, tea and water will be available throughout the day. Drinks at the bar are _not_ included.

The ticket price gets paid directly to the hotel and we do not make any profit from it.

## What are the double rooms

Double rooms have two beds in them and you share the room with someone else. The price of the room is slightly reduced.

Before the event, you can either provide the name of a roommate that also registered with the event or we will find one for you.

## How much does it cost

The below prices represent the total amount per person for the whole stay and are a sum of the fixed costs such as the room cost and the variable costs which depend on the number of participants (such as the conference rooms). Below are cost calculations in the cases of 40, 60 and 90 participants.

If we are **40 participants**:

- 395.50 EUR per participant who shares a double room
- 488.50 EUR per participant who prefers not to share a double room
- 446.50 EUR per participant who prefers the single room

If we are **60 participants**:

- 359.50 EUR per participant who shares a double room
- 452.50 EUR per participant who prefers not to share a double room
- 410.50 EUR per participant who prefers the single room

If we are **90 participants**:

- 335.50 EUR per participant who shares a double room
- 386.50 EUR per participant who prefers the single room

While we certainly hope and expect to see around 60 people to participate, please note that there is always the possibility of some unpredictable short notice cancellations which would move the final cost per participant more towards to 50 participants watermark. Also please understand that the prices shown above are our best effort _approximation_ at this time. The final price will be determined once the conference kicks off.
