The [venue](/venue-and-date), where #humansconf takes place,  can host up to 97 participants (if all double rooms are used by two people). The conference has the venue booked exclusively for the duration of #humansconf, which allows for a great atmosphere of exchange, as everyone at the venue will be a participant. Plus, the fact that the venue is a hotel means that there is no additional travel between venue and accommodation.

## What is included in the price?

A ticket to the conference means there's a room booked on your name at the #humansconf venue.

**When registering for a ticket the organizers won't collect any money from participants. The rooms' costs get paid directly to the hotel and we do not make any profit from it.**

The price of a room include breakfast, lunch and dinner for the whole stay. Throughout Friday and Saturday of the conference snacks, fruits, coffee, tea and water will be available at no cost to participants. Drinks at the bar are _not_ included in the room's price.


## What are the double rooms?

Double rooms have two beds in them and you share the room with someone else. The price of the room is slightly reduced.

When choosing a double room during registration, you can provide us with the name of another person, with whom you want to share the room. This person will have access to conference as well.

## How much does it cost?

The below prices represent the total amount per person for the whole stay and are a sum of the fixed costs such as the room cost and the variable costs (such as the conference rooms) which depend on the number of participants. Below are cost calculations in the cases of 40, 60 and 90 participants.

If we are **40 participants**:

- 395.50 EUR per participant who shares a double room
- 488.50 EUR per participant who prefers not to share a double room
- 446.50 EUR per participant who prefers the single room

If we are **60 participants**:

- 359.50 EUR per participant who shares a double room
- 452.50 EUR per participant who prefers not to share a double room
- 410.50 EUR per participant who prefers the single room

If we are **90 participants**:

- 335.50 EUR per participant who shares a double room
- 386.50 EUR per participant who prefers the single room

While we certainly hope and expect to see around 60 or more people to participate, please note that there is always the possibility of some unpredictable short notice cancellations. This would move the final cost per participant more towards to a lower participants number watermark. Also please understand that the prices shown above are our best effort _approximation_ at this time. The final price will be determined once the conference kicks off.
