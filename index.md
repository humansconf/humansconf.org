## Our Vision

Successful technology products tell a story about humans who came together to solve complex problems that touch people’s lives. It’s a story of collaboration, sharing, communication and empathy. But more often than not, this side of the story gets overlooked in favour of programming languages or frameworks — even though it’s the one piece of the puzzle all successful projects have in common.

We aim to bring together people from all kinds of backgrounds and roles to discuss, share, and celebrate the stories and lessons learnt when humans come together.

As such, you're welcome and we want to hear your stories, want you to share your ideas, no matter what background you have and in what role you've worked in the past or are currently working.


## Virtual Open Space

We're planning our first Virtual Open Space for early June 2020. Sign up for our newsletter to get notified when we release more details.

We will never share your email address with other parties and handle it according to our [privacy policy](/imprint).

Alternatively you can [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/humansconf), as we'll also announce all important updates there too.


## Conference

The initial idea of #humansconf was to bring people together in the form of a conference. A conference for people who are interested in an exchange about human-centered organizations, approaches, techniques and more, in the technology space. It was planned to be organized in the [format of an Open Space](/format), so every participant is a speaker and there’s no distinction between speakers and listeners.

The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 called for [a change of plans](/2020-cancellation). So, we switched to online events.
