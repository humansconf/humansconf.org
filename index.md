## Our Vision

Successful technology products tell a story about humans who came together to solve complex problems that touch people’s lives. It’s a story of collaboration, sharing, communication and empathy. But more often than not, this side of the story gets overlooked in favour of programming languages or frameworks — even though it’s the one piece of the puzzle all successful projects have in common.

We aim to bring together people from all kinds of backgrounds and roles to discuss, share, and celebrate the stories and lessons learnt when humans come together.

As such, you're welcome and we want to hear your stories, want you to share your ideas, no matter what background you have and in what role you've worked in the past or are currently working.


## Conference

The conference is a place for people who are interested in an exchange about human-centered organizations, approaches, techniques and more, in the technology space.

The conference will be organized as an [Open Space](/format), so every participant is a speaker and there’s no distinction between speakers and listeners.

We're a [family][family] and [child-friendly][childcare] event and aim to be as [accessible][accessibility] and inclusive as possible.


### Date

#humansconf will start in the late afternoon of Thursday 21-May-2020 and last until late afternoon of Saturday 23-May-2020. Take a look at our [schedule][schedule], where we listed some more details on the "when".
