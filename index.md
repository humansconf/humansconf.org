## Our Vision

Successful technology products tell a story about humans who came together to solve complex problems that
touch people’s lives. It’s a story of collaboration, sharing, communication and empathy. But more often than
not, this side of the story gets overlooked in favour of programming languages or frameworks — even though
it’s the one piece of the puzzle all successful projects have in common. 

We aim to bring together people from all kinds of backgrounds and roles to discuss, share, and celebrate the
stories and lessons learnt when humans come together.

## Conference

The conference is a place for people who are interested in an exchange about human-centered
organizations, approaches, techniques and more, in the technology space.

The conference will be organized as an open-space, so every participant is a speaker and there’s no distinction
between speakers and listeners.

## Venue

It takes place at [Seminarzentrum Rückersbach](https://www.natuerlich-tagen.de/), which is located near Aschaffenburg,
Germany, which again is ~50km away from Frankfurt am Main, a transport hub with a well-connected train station and
airport.

The venue is surrounded by beautiful nature, and can host up to 90 participants.
The conference has the venue booked exclusively for the duration of #humansconf,
which allows for a great atmosphere of exchange, as everyone at the venue will be a participant.
Plus, the fact that the venue is a hotel, means there’s no additional travel between venue and accommodation
needed, but we all can focus on the conference without having to split up in the evenings. We just stay where
we are and use the space of the venue for whatever we like.
