People from around the world joined the event, as it was fully held online.

## Theme Of The Open Space

**People & their interactions**

Anything about people and how they interact. Ranging from ways to collaborate that foster empathy and insight, strategies for establishing sustainable pace and avoiding burnout, to tips on how to practice closeness when youâ€™re working in a remote team.
Bring your challenges, your questions, your strategies, failures, successes and stories.

## What To Expect

Check out our [description of our first Virtual Open Space](/events/2020-06-02-virtual-open-space) to get a sense of what was going on.

An evening of inspiration, exchange and human connection. We want to host a place for people who are interested in an exchange about human-centered organizations, approaches, techniques and more.

The event was held as a (virtual) Open Space, this means there was no predefined schedule and thus no speakers. Rather, there was space and time for all participants to fill with whatever was important and relevant to them.
