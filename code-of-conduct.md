We, the organisers of #humansconf that is, expect all participants, sponsors and organizers to behave according to our
Code of Conduct - at all events that are hosted under the #humansconf name and in all discussions around these events (online and offline).

Please read our full code of conduct before registering for any of our events, discussing online and before joining us at an event.

At the same time, there's no need don't feel intimidated by it - these are simple rules, and they will make life better for everyone at our events.

## Why we have a Code of Conduct?

We are dedicated to create a community and events where everybody can learn, teach, share, network and have a good time. This can only work when we are inclusive to the largest number of contributors and when we create an environment where everybody feels safe and welcome. And we need your help to achieve that.

## Safe & Welcoming Environment

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

If someone tells you they were harmed by what you said or did, stand back, believe them and take a moment to reflect.  Even if you find yourself not understanding their reasoning, your best reply to that is taking a deep breath and just saying "sorry". That's the baseline of mindfulness and empathy everyone at our events should exhibit.

And so we invite all those who participate in #humansconf and the community surrounding it, to help us create positive experiences for everyone.

Everyone can contribute to creating a safe environment for everyone, by respecting the following rules:

* Speak english throughout our events - participants will join our events from various locations, and you will not be able to guess the languages they speak. In order for everyone to be able to participate in all public conversations that happen at our events, you should speak english throughout the events.
* Use welcoming and inclusive language - Don’t use gendered words to address a group of people. Respect people’s chosen pronouns.
* Treat everyone professionally - Everybody at our events is a professional in their field.
* Treat all attendees as equals - Ask before you teach. Do not explain things without being asked. The person you are talking to right now might know more or different things about the topic than you.
* Be welcoming, friendly, and patient - Give people the benefit of doubt. Ask questions before assuming.
* Be respectful - Not all of us will agree with each other all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to result in treating others poorly.
* Be aware of the effect your words may have on others - Be kind. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment, and other exclusionary behavior are not tolerated.
* Be careful with jokes - We’re all fond of humour, not the least because it’s one of the fundamentals of what makes us human. However, we do not tolerate making fun of others or any other Code of Conduct violations, even if “it was just a joke”.

### Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour includes, but is not limited to:
- Public or private harassment, and other exclusionary behaviour. 
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, personal attacks, deliberate intimidation and threats.
- Aggressive or sexualized language and content. Unwanted sexual advances.
- Publishing or telling others that a participant belongs to a particular identity channel without asking their consent first.
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Well-actually-ing: Telling people what they “actually meant to say”.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

### Code of Conduct Violations

If you think someone has violated our Code of Conduct - even if you were not directly involved, like you just overheard a conversation - please:
- Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop.
- If the person violating our Code of Conduct does not stop the problematic behaviour: Contact the organizers of #humansconf.


Possible actions we will take include:
- Give a warning
- Expel the perpetrator from the conference without a refund
- Call the authorities

### Need Help?

If you need help, have any further questions or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference
organizing team immediately. At the venue, phone numbers of the organizers will be published so you can reach out to
them easily.
