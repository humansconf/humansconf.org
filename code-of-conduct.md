We expect all participants, sponsors and organizers to behave according to our Code of Conduct - both at the conference
and in all discussions around the conference (online and offline).

Please read our full code of conduct before buying a ticket, discussing online and before joining us at the conference.
But please don't feel intimidated by it - these are simple rules, and they will make life better for everyone at the
conference.

## Why we have a Code of Conduct?

We are dedicated to create a conference where everybody can learn, teach, share, network and have a good time. This can
only work when we are inclusive to the largest number of contributors and when we create an environment where everybody
feels safe and welcome. And we need your help to achieve that.

## Safe & Welcoming Environment

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual
orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

If someone tells you they were harmed by what you said or did, stand back, believe them and take a moment to reflect.  
Even if you find yourself not understanding their reasoning, your best reply to that is taking a deep breath and just
saying "sorry". That's the baseline of mindfulness and empathy everyone at the conference should exhibit.

And so we invite all those who participate in #humansconf and the community surrounding it, to help us create positive
experiences for everyone.

Everyone can contribute to creating a safe environment for everyone, by respecting the following rules:

* Speak english throughout the conference - Conference participants will come to the conference from various locations,
  and you will not be able to guess the languages they speak. In order for everyone to be able to participate in all
  public conversations that happen at the conference, you should speak english throughout the conference.
* Use welcoming and inclusive language - Don’t use gendered words to address a group of people. Respect people’s
  chosen pronouns.
* Treat everyone professionally - Everybody at the conference is a professional in their field.
* Treat all attendees as equals -  Ask before you teach. Do not explain things without being asked. The person you are
  talking to right now might know more or different things about the topic than you.
* Be welcoming, friendly, and patient - Give people the benefit of doubt. Ask questions before assuming.
* Be respectful - Not all of us will agree with each other all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor
  behavior. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to result in
  treating others poorly.
* Be aware of the effect your words may have on others - Be kind. Do not insult or put down other participants.
  Harassment, and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable.
* Be careful with jokes - We’re all fond of humour, not the least because it’s one of the fundamentals of what makes us
  human. However, we do not tolerate making fun of others or any other Code of Conduct violations, even if “it was just
  a joke”.

### Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour includes, but is not limited to:
- Public or private harassment, and other exclusionary behaviour. 
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, personal attacks, deliberate intimidation and threats.
- Aggressive or sexualized language and content. Unwanted sexual advances.
- Publishing or telling others that a participant belongs to a particular identity channel without asking their consent
  first.
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Well-actuallies: Telling people what they “actually meant to say”.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

### Code of Conduct Violations

If you think someone has violated our code of conduct - even if you were not directly involved, like you just overheard
a conversation - please:
- Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop.
- Contact the organizers of #humansconf.


Possible actions we will take include:
- Give a warning
- Expel the perpetrator from the conference without a refund
- Call the authorities

### Need Help?

If you need help, have any further questions or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference
organizing team immediately. At the venue, phone numbers of the organizers will be published so you can reach out to
them easily.
